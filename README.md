Welcome to the Bacteria Culture Dashboard, an interactive tool to explore bacterial data through visualizations and insights. This dashboard helps users visualize and understand bacterial cultures using D3.js and Plotly. Whether you're diving into microbiology or just love data visualization, this project has something for you!

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Features Include:
* Dropdown menu to select an individual sample
* Horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs for the selected individual
* Bubble chart displaying all samples for the selected individual
* Display of the selected individual's demographic information
* Automatically updates all visualizations when a new sample is selected
