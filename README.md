# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Features Include:
* Dropdown menu to select an individual sample
* Horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs for the selected individual
* Bubble chart displaying all samples for the selected individual
* Display of the selected individual's demographic information
* Automatically updates all visualizations when a new sample is selected
